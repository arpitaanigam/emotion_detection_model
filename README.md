# emotion_detection_model
A machine learning model that classifies facial emotions into five categories: Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, and Neutral. Built using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV for image preprocessing and deep learning. It supports both real-time video and static image emotion detection.


This project uses deep learning to classify facial emotions into five categories: Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, and Neutral. Built with TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, the model can process both static images and real-time video to predict emotional states.
